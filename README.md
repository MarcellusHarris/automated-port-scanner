# Automated Port Scanner & Vulnerability Assessment

This project presents a Python-based port scanning tool designed to automate the discovery of open ports on a target system. It uses the `nmap` Python module to identify active services and analyze potential vulnerabilities. This project was presented at BootCon in front of an audience of over 300 attendees.

---

## Objective

To develop a Python script that automates the process of scanning open ports and assists in basic vulnerability assessment.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.4 or later  
- Nmap 7.94 or later  
- Target IP address (e.g., local device like a PlayStation 5)

Install the required library using:
